This Rules is essential when writing Api routes. 


-when writing api responses use [errors.ts](mdc:app/api/utils/errors.ts) for throwing api errors.

-use [response.ts](mdc:app/api/utils/response.ts) for returning responses. 
-use a try catch 
-errors in try catch are thrown and handled in the catch block like return Response.error(error)

- the [response.ts](mdc:app/api/utils/response.ts) is also used for seccuss reponses return Response.sucess()
